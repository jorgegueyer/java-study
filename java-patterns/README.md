# Java Patterns

## SOLID Principles

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

It says that a class should have only one reason to change.

What do we mean by responsibility? responsibility is a reason for a change.

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

A software artifact should be open for extension but closed for modification.

The contradiction between the two terms is only apparent as they correspond to goals of a different nature.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## Patterns

1. Iterator pattern
2. Visitor pattern

## Visitor Pattern

Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
